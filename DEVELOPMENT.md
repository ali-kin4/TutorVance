     - `ui/` - Reusable UI components (Icon, Header, Footer)
     - `sections/` - Page sections (Hero, Features, Pricing, etc.)
     - `tutors/` - Tutor-related components
     - `dashboard/` - Dashboard components
     - `modals/` - Modal components
     - `styles/` - Global styles
     - `data/` - Mock data and constants

3. **Error Handling & Loading States**
   - Added comprehensive error handling throughout the app
   - Implemented loading states for search and API calls
   - Added user-friendly error messages with dismiss functionality
   - Proper error boundaries and fallback states

4. **Responsive Design**
   - Enhanced mobile responsiveness across all components
   - Improved breakpoint handling for different screen sizes
   - Better touch targets and mobile-friendly interactions

5. **Accessibility Improvements**
   - Added ARIA labels and roles throughout the application
   - Implemented keyboard navigation (ESC to close modals)
   - Added semantic HTML elements (article, section, etc.)
   - Proper alt text for images and descriptive labels
   - Focus management for modals

6. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implemented React.memo for TutorCard component
   - Added useMemo for expensive operations
   - Lazy loading for dashboard components
   - Suspense boundaries with loading fallbacks
   - Image lazy loading

## Environment Setup

1. Copy `env.example` to `.env.local`
2. Add your API keys:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY` - For AI features
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - For database (optional)
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - For database (optional)

## Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run start        # Start production server
npm run test:run     # Run tests (when testing is set up)
```

## Key Features

### AI Integration
- Gemini API integration for AI chat and quiz generation
- Graceful fallback when API keys are not configured
- Proper error handling and user feedback

### Tutor Management
- Comprehensive tutor profiles with ratings and verification
- Search and filtering functionality
- Sponsored content support
- Responsive card layout

### Dashboard System
- Role-based dashboards (Student, Tutor, Admin)
- Lazy-loaded components for better performance
- Interactive learning paths
- Tool integration

### Accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 compliant design
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly
- High contrast support

## Performance Features

- **Code Splitting**: Dashboard components are lazy-loaded
- **Memoization**: TutorCard uses React.memo
- **Image Optimization**: Lazy loading for tutor avatars
- **Bundle Optimization**: Modular component structure

## Testing

Test files are set up but testing framework installation was skipped due to network issues. Tests are located in:
- `app/components/ui/__tests__/Icon.test.jsx`
- `app/components/tutors/__tests__/TutorCard.test.jsx`

To set up testing later:
```bash
npm install --save-dev vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event jsdom @vitejs/plugin-react
```
